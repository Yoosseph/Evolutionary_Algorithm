# Evolutionary Algorithm – N-Queens Solver

This project implements an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to solve the classic N-Queens problem. It includes modular algorithm components, visualization utilities, and scripts for running simulations and analyzing results.

## Features

### Core Evolutionary Algorithm
- Population initialization
- Fitness evaluation
- Selection strategies
- Mutation and recombination mechanisms
- Execution loop with configurable parameters
- Multiple algorithm variants (basic and extended implementations)

### N-Queens Problem
- Board representation and state transitions
- Fitness function based on number of conflicts
- Utilities for tracking and displaying board states

### Visualization and Analysis
- Plotting tools for algorithm performance over generations
- Sample output images and data included in the Results directory

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Required libraries: matplotlib, numpy

### Running the Evolutionary Algorithm
Run a simulation using:
python simple_implementation.py

Or use the Windows script:
run_simulations.bat

### Plotting Results
python plot.py

## Configuration

You can adjust algorithm parameters inside the implementation scripts, such as:
- Population size
- Mutation rate
- Selection strategy
- Maximum generations
- Board size (N)

Configurations can be modified in:
- Main/evolutionary_algorithm.py
- simple_implementation.py
- Parameter files in the Results folder

## Results

The Results directory contains:
- Output logs
- Parameter sets
- Performance plots
- Example solved board visualizations
